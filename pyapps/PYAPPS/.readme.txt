My thanks to Discord user aveferrum#9190 and Github user notro

Python/         This folder contains python executable and libraries. Note the file adb_run_repl.sh, that launches Python3 repl at ADB Shell.
fbtft_test/     Here we have the test script and library for framebuffers in pure python
sample/         Sample app based on aveferrum's Python3_SAMPLE file.

It's a good start to have a framebuffer library but I'm still working on a way to make use of libSDL in this device

How to use
Copy the PYAPPS folder to your SDCARD/Roms folder
Change /CFW/config/coremapping.json (ROMS partition) by adding the line at the end of the list
"PYAPPS": "/bin/sh",
